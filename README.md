**Teknolojik Yemekler - SPA Challenge**

This project is a fully functional Single Page Application (SPA) developed as part of the Workintech bootcamp. It showcases advanced concepts in React and modern web development practices, with a focus on creating an intuitive food-ordering experience.

### Project Features

**User-Friendly Interface:**  
Built a responsive design that ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience across all devices.

**Dynamic Order Form:**  
Developed a detailed order form using **Formik** and **MUI** for:

- Real-time validation for names and ingredient selection.
- Customizable pizza sizes using radio buttons and multi-select topping options.

**Routing and State Management:**  
Implemented navigation with **React Router** and managed data flow across pages using **Prop-Lifting**, avoiding the use of global state management tools.

**API Integration with Axios:**  
Simulated real-world API behavior by sending POST requests to a mock server, validating form data, and dynamically returning responses.

**Comprehensive Testing:**  
Used **Cypress** to implement thorough tests for:

- Input validation.
- Multi-select functionality for ingredients.
- Successful form submissions.

**Design Precision:**  
Followed Figma designs to create a pixel-perfect interface, focusing on accessibility and a modern user experience.

### Key Technologies Used

- **React** for building dynamic components.
- **Formik** for form handling and validation.
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for consistent, responsive UI components.
- **React Router** for seamless navigation.
- **Axios** for API communication.
- **Cypress** for end-to-end testing.
- **CSS** for additional design and responsiveness.

This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable, user-friendly applications while adhering to modern development standards and best practices.
